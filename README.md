# Hangman

Just a small hangman game to practice my JavaScript. 

## Theme

As a fan of comic books (Go DC), I made this one based on a list of superheroes. To guide the players towards victory - or *death* (depends of the skill level) - I drew a little model to mark their progress. 

### Addendum

Stop reading, it won't help you play the game.
